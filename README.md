This is my simple home server setup that will be ever-changing. I hope to
document everything here in order to share my findings and config, but also
to back up my setup with just the non-persistent elements. Follow my journey
here: https://sites.google.com/view/duiyhomeserverblog/home.

I'll add more information here as it becomes available or pertinent.
