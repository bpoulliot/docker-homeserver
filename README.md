# docker-smarthome

This is my simple home server setup that will be ever-changing. I hope to
document everything here in order to share my findings and config, but also
to back up my setup with just the non-persistent elements. Follow my journey
here: https://sites.google.com/view/duiyhomeserverblog/home.

I'll add more information here as it becomes available or pertinent.
CHANGELOG 2020-11-21: removed youtube-dl and booksonic-air. added heimdall. calibre centralized in shared dir for lazylibrarian, calibre guac, and calibre web. calibre setup needs to be examined. ombi up and running. need to work on transmission/media library duplication.
